## This is my Multi Agent Financial Assitance

## My check list

### Survey

- Agent: What is?
- Search Engine: DuckDuckGo
- RAG
- Memory: Document, DB handling
- Basic pipeline:
  - Reasoning though (Planing) - Use prompt
  - Action: use tool: search engine + RAG
  - Searching:
  - Retrieval relevant document (Need a measure)
  - Embedding document (Some emb from hugging face)
  - Save to database (memory)
    - Clear temp file (if needed)
- Retrieval from RAG (search + user document)
  - User document may need PDF reader and Image reader?? (Some tool in Python PyPDF)
- Prompt conversation: {role} {context}?? ()
- Streamlit on Colab(Try and success), Kaggle (fail: Idk), Flask for simple(I try this first)
- Inject to Finance Tracker project?? (Through Rest API)

- Langchain support a good tool (Why don't I use it sooner????:((( )
