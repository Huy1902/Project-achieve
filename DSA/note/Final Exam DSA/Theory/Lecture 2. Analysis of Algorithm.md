- Count time complexity from data: using log-log and double hypothesis
- Time complexity from code: using cost model and tilde notation to simplify counts
- Replace sum with an integral, and use calculus
- Binary search: at most 1 + lg(N) (aka worst case)
- Remarkable notation: Big Theta (ensure order of growth) and Big Oh (we don't know it's, for ex, $N^{2}$  or $N$  )
- Big Oh is not an approximate model $\neq$ tilde $\sim$ (providing both an upper bound and lower bound on the function)
